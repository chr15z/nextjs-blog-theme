| Input                | Output               |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
|This is the part, where a paper and a pencil helps for sure. As an input we get the current position (row, col) we would like to fill an certain number (= num) in.You can split the method in three parts, whenever any part returns False, the method ends. First we check if any number in the same col equals our num. If not we keep going and check the exect same think with the numbers in the same row. If there is no match we can keep going and come to the last part. In this part we determine the first spot in the 3x3 section. This is the starting point of a double for loop in which we check if any of the numbers in the section is equal to our input. If not we can safely return true :)  | ```python def is_num_possible(row, col, num, arr):    for row_i in range(9):        if arr[row_i][col] is num:            return False    for col_i in range(9):        if arr[row][col_i] is num:            return False    upper_left_row = (row // 3) * 3    upper_left_col = (col // 3) * 3    for row_i in range(3):        for col_i in range(3):            if arr[upper_left_row + row_i][upper_left_col + col_i] == num:                return False    return True```|
