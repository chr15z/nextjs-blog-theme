## Problem Solving

##Sudoku explanation and then we come to the code

## Code implemented in python

```
def solve_sudoku(arr):
    for row_i in range(9):
        for col_i in range(9):
            if arr[row_i][col_i] == 0:
                for num in range(1, 10):
                    if is_num_possible(row_i, col_i, num, arr):
                        arr[row_i][col_i] = num
                        solve_sudoku(arr)
                        arr[row_i][col_i] = 0
                return
    print_sudoku(arr)
```


```
def is_num_possible(row, col, num, arr):
    for row_i in range(9):
        if arr[row_i][col] is num:
            return False
    for col_i in range(9):
        if arr[row][col_i] is num:
            return False
    upper_left_row = (row // 3) * 3
    upper_left_col = (col // 3) * 3
    for row_i in range(3):
        for col_i in range(3):
            if arr[upper_left_row + row_i][upper_left_col + col_i] == num:
                return False
    return True
```

## Outlook

Due to my health informatics studys i wanted to get used to OpenCV and this project seems like a good fit. As an input i want an image of a sudoku. A method should transform this picture to an 2d array which can be solved with the descriped algorithm. Right now the only way to implement this method is with the help of ML and this is completely new to me. It will take some time to get used to the concept and find a model that fits or create an own.
